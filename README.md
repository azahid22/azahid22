# 👋 Hi, I'm Ali Zahid

Senior Software Engineer with **11+ years of experience** building and operating
**production-grade backend systems** in **FinTech and payment platforms**.

I have worked extensively on **payment authentication, transaction processing,
and distributed backend services**, with hands-on ownership of reliability,
performance optimization, and regulatory compliance (Visa, Mastercard, AMEX,
UnionPay 3DS).

I enjoy solving real backend problems — correctness, scalability, and stability
matter more to me than hype.
